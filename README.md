# README

Quick overview of the mini-app.

- **Used**
  - Bootstrap 5
  - jQuery _(Been a while)_
  - PHP 8.1.7 (Vanilla)
    - _A few things are type hinted, shouldn't be a problem in PHP 7.x.x_
- **Instructions**
  - `/api/search.php` has the DB analytics insert.
    - Comments were left to skip testing.
    - `sqldump.sql` is available to test SQL if needed.
- **Bugs**
  - I have no idea why the `X` on the modal refuses to close it, adding a button with `data-bs-dismiss` wasn't working either but I didn't want to spend too much time over a little thing. _(Just click outside the modal)_
- **Purposely Avoided** _(For the sake of this test)_
  - Composer (Any Libraries/Utils/Frameworks)
  - NodeJS (Any Bundlers/Vite/ES6/React)
  - Theming Bootstrap (Not what this is about)
- **Notes**
  - Did not go wild making it look pretty, only functional. I prefer SCSS but CSS decent when using `:root {}` and `var(--name)`.
  - Folder structure and files are probably not how I'd imagine doing a real project with more planning.
  - I was going to grab some fancy trinkets from `codepen.io` to save time to look cool but that's kind of cheating.
  - I really don't like having all that javascript in one file _(why I like bundlers)_, for just a few features it gets so messy!

Thanks for your consideration!
Jesse Boyer.
